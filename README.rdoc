= Group Manager Plugin

This plugin provides a project tab for group management. A Redmine administrator can allow project roles of non-admin users to change group membership, view, create or delete admin created groups or other users' groups. Permissions of operations on groups are managed from the roles permissions tab in the Administration menu.
Adding or deleting users is allowed in scope of the project. 

If you have got user custom fields, they will be displayed in the group view.

Note: You cannot add users which is not a project member. This is an administrator privilege.
